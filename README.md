![HAVEN Banner](https://i.ibb.co/BKcR3Bfb/Git-Hub-Ban.png)

**HAVEN** (Harmonious Adventure & Visual Expression Network) is a **completely free, peaceful alternative** to expensive mod menus like Fortitude ($50).

## 🛡️ Anti-Crash Protection

HAVEN includes comprehensive protection against griefing from expensive menus like Fortitude:

### Features:
- **Rate Limiting**: Blocks spam attacks (100 events/second threshold)
- **Sync Blocking**: Prevents malicious entity syncing
- **Network Event Filtering**: Blocks known crash exploits
- **Real-Time Stats**: See protection activity in overlay
- **Auto-Ban System**: Automatically blocks repeat offenders

### Why This Matters:
Fortitude users (who paid $50) often grief free players by spamming network events to crash their game. HAVEN's protection ensures you can play peacefully without being harassed by paid menu users.

## 🔧 Technical Documentation

### How It Works:

HAVEN is **NOT a virus** - it's a mod menu that uses RDR2's native game functions through memory manipulation. Here's how it works:

#### 1. **Native Function Calls**
RDR2 has built-in functions for everything (spawning objects, changing weather, etc.). HAVEN just calls these functions:

```cpp
// Example: Spawning an object
Hash modelHash = "p_chair05x"_J;  // Chair model
STREAMING::REQUEST_MODEL(modelHash, false);  // Ask game to load model
Object obj = OBJECT::CREATE_OBJECT(modelHash, x, y, z, true, true, false, false, false);
```

This is the SAME way the game spawns objects internally. We're not hacking or exploiting - just calling existing functions.

#### 2. **Particle Effects**
Fire trails, sparkles, etc. use the game's particle system:

```cpp
STREAMING::REQUEST_NAMED_PTFX_ASSET("core"_J);
GRAPHICS::USE_PARTICLE_FX_ASSET("core");
GRAPHICS::_START_PARTICLE_FX_NON_LOOPED_ON_PED_BONE_2(
    "proj_flare_fuse", ped, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, boneIndex, 0.3f, false, false, false
);
```

The game already has all these effects for missions - we just trigger them.

#### 3. **Build Mode**
The top-down camera is created using the game's camera system:

```cpp
Cam camera = CAM::CREATE_CAM("DEFAULT_SCRIPTED_CAMERA", true);
CAM::SET_CAM_ROT(camera, pitch, roll, yaw, 2);
CAM::SET_CAM_ACTIVE(camera, true);
CAM::RENDER_SCRIPT_CAMS(true, false, 3000, true, false, 0);
```

Nothing malicious - just moving the camera.

#### 4. **Anti-Crash Protection**
Rate limiting is simple counting:

```cpp
if (eventCount > 100) {  // More than 100 events per second?
    return true;  // Block it (it's spam)
}
```

We're not "hacking back" - just refusing to process spam.

### Why These Features Are Possible:

- **Sky Colors**: Game has timecycle modifiers for different atmospheres
- **Slow Motion**: Game has time scale for cutscenes
- **Model Changing**: Game swaps player model for story missions
- **Flying**: Disable gravity flag that's used for swimming
- **Telekinesis**: Move entity coords + freeze physics
- **Fireworks**: Spawn explosion particles at calculated positions

Everything is built-in to RDR2 already - HAVEN just exposes it to players!

## 🌟 Our Vision

HAVEN exists because **gaming should be accessible and therapeutic, not expensive and toxic.**

Too many players - especially those with autism, PTSD, anxiety, and other conditions - rely on games like RDR2 as peaceful escapes. When menus like Fortitude charge $50 and include griefing tools, they're:

1. **Gatekeeping creativity** behind paywalls
2. **Enabling toxicity** with harassment features
3. **Harming peaceful players** who just want to build and explore

HAVEN is our answer: **A completely free, 100% peaceful, feature-rich alternative** that puts creativity and expression first.

### Join the Movement:
- ⭐ **Star this repo** to show support for free, peaceful gaming
- 🔄 **Share HAVEN** with players who can't afford expensive menus
- 🤝 **Contribute features** that enhance creativity and expression
- 💬 **Spread the word** that gaming can be peaceful AND free
